## 1. Breakdown Points Based on Skills Requirement

### User Requirements
- **Categorized Questions:**
  - As a developer, questions should be formed correctly into various categories and differentiated answers to help AI training.
  - This categorization helps track training progress in an organized and accurate manner.
  
- **Bias-Free Training Questions:**
  - As a developer, datasets should be balanced to reduce biases in AI models.
  - This balancing ensures that data is validated.


### System-based Requirements
- **Collection of Data Automatically:**
  - The system should utilize methodologies to collect classified and random data from the web.
  - This helps set up a system with filtered and marked collected data.
  
- **Verify & Clean Data:**
  - The system should utilize tools to identify and remove replicated and unrelated data.
  - This ensures that data is unique and free from biases.
  
- **Store & Access Data:**
  - The system should secure data so it can be accessed easily.
  - This helps to keep data updated and control access across various tools.


## 2. Defining Functional & System Requirement

### Functional Requirement
- **Collect Data from Web:**
  - As a developer, utilize automated scripts to collect publicly available training data.
  - Set up APIs to collect and filter questions separately from answers.
  
- **Organize Data:**
  - Utilize NLP methodologies to categorize questions by topic difficulty.
  - This helps store filtered questions in an organized manner.
  
- **Reduce Bias:**
  - Create an algorithm to search and remove bias in training data.
  - This ensures representation is balanced.
  
- **Store & Manage Data:**
  - Use SQL/NoSQL databases to store organized data.
  - Mention tags to ensure data is easily searchable.

### System Requirement
- **Handling Data:**
  - The system should handle the rise in amounts of data efficiently.
  
- **Security & Rules:**
  - The system should observe laws of data protection such as GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, PDPA, and POPIA.
  - Implement secure authentication techniques for easy access to data.

- **Performance:**
  - The system should ensure quicker extraction of data.
  - This helps prevent the risk of IP bans and captchas.
  
- **Accessibility:**
  - The system should offer a user-friendly interface.
  - This helps developers to handle and access data easily.


## 3. Questions for Functional & System Requirement

### Functional Requirement Questions
- Which level of permission should be granted to developers for filtering data?
- Which machine learning models could help search for bias and accurate data?
- How should the system manage replicated or additional data?
- Should the system verify biased data once received?
- How should the system monitor sensitive data?
- Which tools should be used by developers to collect and arrange data?
- How should developers ensure the system manages large data?
- How should developers trace changes in data?
- How should developers verify that the system detects bias efficiently?
- How should developers manage the collection of undesirable data?

### System Requirement Questions
- How should the system arrange categories for static or dynamic questions?
- Which procedures should the system use to search for bias and accurate data?
- From where should the system collect any legitimate data problems?
- Which database should the system use for storing and searching data easily?
- How should the system collect large amounts of data?
- Which procedures should the system have to link APIs or other services for data collection?
- How should the system manage misplaced data?
- How should the system enhance data accuracy?
- How should the system fix errors while collecting data?


## 4. Next Steps for Development
- Generate automated bots to collect and organize data.
- Choose between SQL & NoSQL databases to work with large data.
- Apply machine learning to track bias in data.
- Grant permission to users who can access and handle data.
- Ensure data collection follows legitimate processes.
- Design the system to manage large data.
- Implement encryption to track sensitive data when it's stored or sent.
- Generate procedures to enhance data before it's stored or sent.
- Set up backups and recovery plans to prevent data loss.
- Verify the system handles security issues and enhance protection regularly.


## 5. Best Practices
- Obey website rules and use APIs whenever possible.
- Secure data with encryption and limit access permissions.
- Obey data protection laws.
- Utilize scripts to search for replication, biases, or mistakes.
- Alter IPs and use proxies to prevent bans.
- Observe responses and requests to handle issues efficiently.
- Update collected data regularly.
- Handle failed responses or requests and retry efficiently.
- Develop modules to search and fix inconsistencies.
- Track records of where data comes from, how it's collected, and how it's checked.


## 6. Assumptions

### Functional Requirement Assumptions
- AI models require an organized dataset for categorizing questions.
- Bias reduction must apply while data is processed.
- Developers require a user-friendly interface to access training modules.
- Validating data must demonstrate replication and defects.
- AI models require tracking of updated data patterns.
- Apply defect handling modules to manage failed issues.
- Schedule data updates at regular intervals to track accurate data.
